# autoai-project
ðŸš€ Automated ML with IBM Watson Studio & AutoAI
This tool leverages IBM Watson Studio (or watsonx.ai Runtime) to fully automate the machine learning lifecycleâ€”from raw data ingestion to production deploymentâ€”with zero manual pipeline design. It uses the builtâ€‘in AutoAI engine to perform:

Data preprocessing, feature detection, imputation, encoding, and scaling

Automated feature engineering and model selection (generating multiple candidate pipelines and ranking them on a leaderboard)

Hyperparameter optimization, ensembling, and optional incremental learning

Code generation of highâ€‘fidelity Python notebooks, encapsulating both the full experiment and individual pipeline logic for reproducibility and auditability

Once a winning pipeline is selected, the system can promote it directly to a RESTful model deployment using IBM Watson Machine Learning APIs. It supports both online (web-service) and batch scoring scenarios

. You also receive a readyâ€‘toâ€‘use Python SDK client that handles scoring (prediction) requests, making it trivial to integrate the model into any application.

ðŸ”§ Key capabilities
Feature	Description
Raw data â†’ deployed model	Initiate an AutoAI experiment using CSV/Parquet data or cloud object storage. The system auto-analyzes and preps data and builds multiple ML pipelinesâ€”all without writing a single line of code.
Model candidate leaderboard	AutoAI ranks pipelines by crossâ€‘validation scoring, highlighting feature transformations, algorithms, and metrics.
Notebook export	The system autoâ€‘generates two annotated Jupyter notebooksâ€”one reflecting the full experiment and another for each pipelineâ€”each fully runnable and exportable for audit or extension.
Model evaluation & deployment	Choose a pipeline, save as model, and deploy to IBM Cloudâ€¯Pak or Watson Machine Learning as a REST API endpoint.
Python SDK & scoring client	Autoâ€‘generated Python code provides endâ€‘toâ€‘end API calls: training, deployment, scoring, batch processing, and loggingâ€”all optimized for integration into workflows or apps.

âœ… How to use
Upload your dataset to a Watson Studio or Cloud Pak for Data project (or connect via network volume or COS).

Launch an AutoAI experimentâ€”select target column, data type, resource configuration.

AutoAI runs preprocessing, feature engineering, HPO, and training.

Review the pipeline leaderboard and select the best model pipeline.

Choose Save as Model, and use the notebook export to customize or review the pipeline code.

Deploy the selected pipeline as an online or batch web-service via the Watson Machine Learning API (e.g. WebService.create() or Batch.create()).

Use the generated Python SDK to score new data or integrate model predictions into your applications.

With this repository at the heart of your project, you can empower domain experts, analysts, and developers to build, understand, and deploy machine learning models with unprecedented speed and minimal codeâ€”while maintaining full transparency, explainability, and governance.
